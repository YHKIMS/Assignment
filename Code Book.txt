1. About train data

(1) train : read "x_train.txt" in R-Studio
(2) train_subject : subject of train(1 to 30)
(3) train_activity : activity of train(6 activities)
(4) train_dataset: train dataset combind "x_train", "tarin_subject" and "train_activity" with cbind function

2. About test data

(1) test : read "x_test.txt" in R-Studio
(2) test_subject : subject of test(1 to 30)
(3) test_activity : activity of train(6 activities)
(4) test_dataset: train dataset combind "x_test", "test_subject" and "test_activity" with cbind function

3. About full dataset( merge train and test data)

(1) features: read "features.txt" in R-Studio and convert it as character variable (there are 561 features)
(2) full_dataset: literally, full dataset which has both train_dataset and test_dataset

4. About extracted dataset(extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurements)

(1) full_dataset_sub : subsetting full_dataset with the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurements

5. About descriptive activity names
(1) activity_name: read "activity_labels.txt" in R-Studio as a character value
(2) full_dataset_sub$activities : replace "activities" column in full_dataset_sub with activity_name using revalue function in plyr package

6. About second tidy-dataset 

(1) full_dataset_sub_second : final output of this project, tidy-datasets with the average of each variable for each activity and  each subject
